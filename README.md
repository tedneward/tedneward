# Ted Neward
Hello! Welcome to my GitHub. I've got a bunch of things up here, many of which public (and more than a few private), reflecting the fact that I've always got my hands in five or six or twelve or twenty different projects and ideas at a time. :-)

### I'm currently working on ...
... a couple of different projects outside of work. One is a world for the players (buddies from college lo these many years ago) in my D&D 5e game, and probably won't be much help to anyone unless you're in that game--unless you want to use [Azgaarnoth](https://github.com/tedneward/Azgaarnoth) as a template or something for your own games. *shrug* That's up to you.

The official [Architectural Katas](http://www.architecturalkatas.com) repositories are here: one for the [katas themselves in raw form](https://github.com/tedneward/ArchKatas), one for the [web client](https://github.com/tedneward/ArchKatasCode), and one for a [Katas CLI](https://github.com/tedneward/ArchKatasCLI). Hopefully this makes it easier for people to suggest some new kata ideas (in the form of a pull request, of course).

I just recently made public my [XML-and-Markdown slide system](https://github.com/tedneward/pptbuilder), which is a v2 of a tool I originally built over a decade ago in F# using Office Automation to drive PowerPoint; the new version uses Apache POI to write the office XML format directly, which is a lot faster and (I expect) a lot more CI/CD'able. The next step is to get it to transform into HTML/Slidy and PDF formats, and then CI/CD my private presentation repo and put the HTML or PDFs someplace up on my website.

Another is [my collection of links and pages for research purposes](https://github.com/tedneward/Research). It's a pretty random collection, and I'm generally always adding stuff to it.

There's a few "working labs" kind of project repos, which I use for conference workshops and the like:

* [Angular](https://github.com/tedneward/AngularLabs)
* [React](https://github.com/tedneward/ReactLabs)
* [Vue](https://github.com/tedneward/VueLabs)
* [simplevm](https://github.com/tedneward/simplevm)

... none of which are guaranteed to make much sense without having taking the workshop, but you're welcome to explore anyway.

### Demos
I've recently been putting all the demo code that goes into my presentations into GitHub repositories and referencing the salient parts from the presentations (via HTTP links). I use these also for my UW teaching gigs.

### UW Homework Assignments
Speaking of which, if you're one of my UW students, here's a partial list of the homework assignments for the various courses I've taught. If you're not one of my UW students, maybe you want to take a crack at one or more of them, just for funsies. :-)

There's a few other examples kind of projects in here, most of which are probably horribly out of date and should be deleted.

### I'm currently learning ...
... a long list of different things that I wouldn't even begin to try to list out here. Collectively, it's a list of "how to implement languages", "how to implement games", "how to implement virtual machines" (like the JVM or CLR), and some other various development tools.

### Ask me about ...
... whatever comes to mind?

### How to reach me ...
You can always [email](mailto:ted@tedneward.com), [tweet](https://twitter.com/tedneward), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedneward/), and if that doesn't give you enough options I suppose you could always [Google](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=ted+neward) me and see what comes up.

### Pronouns: he, him, his
And yes, pronouns matter to people, because they matter to people. It's the simplest of courtesies to refer to someone as they wish to be referred.

### Fun fact:
I don't have a degree in Computer Science, and in fact I maintain that my liberal arts degree (International Relations) prepared me better for a career in development and programming than any CompSci degree program I've ever seen.
